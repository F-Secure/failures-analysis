# Failure analysis
Tests failure analysis package provides fast and reliable way to find and group similar failures in your CI/CD
pipeline. When failure grouping and similarity scoring is done automatically by a machine, it will free
resources from development team member to fix the most important failures in their CI/CD pipeline. It is tedious
work for a human to download, open and read all the test failures and analyse which failures belong to the same group.
The failure-analysis package solves this problem by processing xunit xml files and using XXXXXX to find similar
failures from the test results.

# Features
