description = "Tests failure analysis package provides fast and reliable way to find and group similar failures in your CI/CD pipeline. When failure grouping and similarity scoring is done automatically by a machine, it will free resources from development team member to fix the most important failures in their CI/CD pipeline. It is tedious work for a human to download, open and read all the test failures and analyse which failures belong to the same group. The failure-analysis package solves this problem by processing xunit xml files and using XXXXXX to find similar failures from the test results."
